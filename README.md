# Conclave

Conclave is a multi-agent consensus development system for coding agents. It orchestrates a council of AI reviewers (Claude, Gemini, and Codex) that independently analyze your work, synthesize their perspectives, and produce prioritized recommendations - all built on top of composable "skills" that activate automatically at the right moments.

## How It Works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. Before any code gets written, the system activates a brainstorming skill that teases out what you're actually trying to build through structured questions. You can answer interactively, or switch to **Consensus Autopilot** mode where the council of AI agents debates each design decision while you watch and intervene only when needed.

Once the design is validated (by multi-agent consensus), the system generates an implementation plan broken into bite-sized tasks. Each task gets dispatched to a fresh subagent with two-stage review: spec compliance first, then code quality. At every checkpoint, the council weighs in - architecture validation on plans, per-task review during execution, root cause validation during debugging, and a final multi-agent check before you merge.

The result: your coding agent works autonomously for hours at a time, with multiple AI perspectives catching issues that any single reviewer would miss. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special.

## Multi-Agent Consensus

Consensus review triggers automatically at key workflow points:

```
Brainstorming -> Writing Plans -> Execution -> Debugging -> Verification
     |              |              |           |            |
  Design        Architecture    Per-task    Root cause   Final check
  validation    validation      review      validation   before done
```

**7 skills enhanced with consensus:**
- `brainstorming` - Design validation + autopilot mode
- `writing-plans` - Architecture/risk/scope validation
- `subagent-driven-development` - Third review stage after code quality
- `executing-plans` - Consensus review after each batch
- `finishing-a-development-branch` - Final review before merge
- `systematic-debugging` - Root cause hypothesis validation
- `verification-before-completion` - Multi-agent final check

### Consensus Autopilot

In brainstorming, you can choose **Consensus Autopilot** mode:

```
Two modes available:
1. Interactive - I ask questions, you answer
2. Consensus Autopilot - Multi-agent consensus answers questions,
   you watch and can interrupt anytime to override
```

The council debates each design decision while you watch. Interrupt anytime to override, go back, or take over.

### Using Consensus Directly

```bash
# Review code changes
./skills/multi-agent-consensus/auto-review.sh "Added authentication"

# Review with explicit base
./skills/multi-agent-consensus/auto-review.sh --base=HEAD~5 "Recent fixes"

# General question
./skills/multi-agent-consensus/consensus-synthesis.sh \
  --mode=general-prompt \
  --prompt="What could go wrong with this architecture?" \
  --context="$(cat design.md)"
```

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add signalnine/honest-gabes-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install conclave@honest-gabes-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check that commands appear:

```bash
/help
```

```
# Should see:
# /conclave:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement
# /conclave:write-plan - Create implementation plan
# /conclave:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalnine/conclave/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalnine/conclave/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Multi-reviewer consensus from Claude, Gemini, and Codex. Groups issues by agreement level (all agree -> high priority, majority -> medium, single -> consider). Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.
